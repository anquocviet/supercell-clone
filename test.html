                     mental health and also reduce the stigma,” says Mansford. “If people aren’t talking
                     about it, then that’s a problem in itself.” Staff can ask to be trained like mental
                     health first aiders under a program called ‘Jedis of the mind’, and in Helsinki there’s
                     a psychologist on-site twice a week. There are a raft of other training and online
                     resources for staff who want to learn more in a less public way as well.
